Neo pragmatist final vocabularies are often institutional arrangements. And truths are 
weakened when institutions are degrading. 

I think that this is related to the simplicity project in some abstruse way. Strong institutional structures dissolve into the background--they are a party of a unified whole of life. They appear simple in a relevant sense.  They may encapsulate procedurual complexity to create substantive simplicity. See:
