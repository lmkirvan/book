Fat tailed process problems (i.e., a process that must handle lots of unique instances or a wide range of possible outcomes.). 

This is the source of a lot of issues with bureaucracy, at least supposedly. But it's also a problem for markets. And most people wouldn't want the businesses solution to this problem (perfect price descrimination through risk based-pricing). 

[[2021-12-31-simplicity]] is, in part, an answer to this critique. The original pro-privitaztion critique is based around the simplicity of incentives in markets compared with democratically and politically accountable governments. But markets create fat tailed problems, and can't deal with them. Creating a socialist counterweight to the cost-benefit "simplicification" and the privitization "simplification" is one major goal.
