This idea is a motivating structure for the [[thesis]]. I've had a lingering version of this debate my whole adult life. My moral and ethical impulses point very clearly to socialism as correct and the only humane way to organize life on earth. And yet, I do clearly see the attraction of the conservative and skeptical critique of organization on the scale that seems necessary. This socialist calculation problem is a motivating factor for the book, as I think that forcing state bureacracies to value solutions differently could mend this rupture. If the bureacracy had a mission to simplify rules, lives, procedures, it could paradoxically make the calculation debate less important. It requires a near total protanic reversal from the view of bureacracy advanced by 20th century social science.
