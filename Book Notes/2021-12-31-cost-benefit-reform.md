Thinking about the role of cost benefit reforms. I wonder what role general social science principles could play. Remove it from the realm of technochratic accountancy and plant it firmly in the realm of science. The goal would be to really quantify our degree of uncertainty in the result of any particular regulation. The proposed reform could be to require an experimental structure when uncertainty is great.

This relates to the idea of [[2021-12-31-substantive-procedural-distinction]] on the procedural side of things.  There's a lot more to be said about cost benefit reform.
