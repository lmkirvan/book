from rob hyndman: it is not possible to accurately prediction stock prices with time series models.  Anything beyond predicting the sign of the next period is unlikely to be very accurate.  Otherwise he'd be rich. 

This also relates to the idea of simplicity through the [[2021-12-31-socialist calculation debate]]. Because prediction is hard making things more proceduraly simple makes tasks like prediction, estimation, and calculation easier and more transparent. this relates to the purpose of the book as well.
