Do arguments motivated by virtues require virtuous recipients? Seems like assuming shared values as a basis for motivating virtuous behavior is not easy to fix. 

I can see how this might relate to problems when institutions fail e.g. [[2021-12-31-pragmatists]] or [[2022-01-16-common-law]] or [[2022-01-16-subject-OPEN]]

I think I was listening to a Sandel lecture about his 2020 book.
